## Introduction

[LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org/) is a standard format used by CAD
applications that create LEGO models and scenes.

The `pyldraw` package provides facilities to allow users to create LDraw
scene descriptions using the [Python](http://www.python.org/)
programming language. Pieces are specified by their positions,
orientations and other properties in normal executable Python scripts
which are run to create model files.

The `pyldraw` package includes code to have the complete LDraw library
available to you through normal Python imports, like:

```python
from ldraw.library.colours import Light_Grey
from ldraw.library.parts.minifig.accessories import Seat2X2
from ldraw.library.parts.others import Brick1X2WithClassicSpaceLogoPattern
```

The actual parts library hierarchy (in which subpackage each brick is,
etc\...), is still a work in progress. You can always specify parts by
their LDraw code:

```python
rover = group()
Piece(Light_Grey, Vector(-10, -32, -90),
          Identity(), "3957a", rover)
```

## Compatibility

This is tested on Python 2.7, and 3.4+

## Installation

The simplest way is through pip:

    pip install pyldraw

## Auto-generation of the ldraw.library.\* package

The ldraw.library.\* package is kind of special, it is auto-generated
from a LDraw parts library (complete.zip) with the parts.lst itself
auto-generated using
[pymklist](https://github.com/rienafairefr/pymklist). On running code
that needs something in the ldraw.library, pyldraw will know (through a
`sys.meta_path` hook) and attempt to auto-generate it on-the-fly.
Considering that the toolchain complete.zip download, parts.lst
generation, python code generation takes quite some time, and we don\'t
want to re-download anyway, the generated library will be cached and
reused on subsequent import or python scripts run. If you setup another
parts.lst or modify it, the library will be re-generated. The cached
generated library is stored in the directory where the ldraw package is,
if that\'s user-writeable, otherwise in an OS-dependent cache directory
(somewhere in `~/.local` for Linux)

-   Configuration

The parts.lst that is used for this generation is setup inside the
configuration file (a simple YAML file) To get some info about where the
configuration file is, use `python -m ldraw.config` You can specify
where the library is generated by providing a `library` option in this
configuration file

## Examples

A number of examples are provided in the `examples` directory. When run,
each of these will write model information to the console. To create a
model file from an example, redirect its output to a file.

## Part Descriptions

Even though this package does include a list of parts derived from those
supplied in the official LDraw archive, users can download or modify
this list separately. The ldraw.library.\* hierarchy will stay current
with the LDraw database setup in the configuration

Parts are available from the ldraw.library namespace as described above,
but you can also use the Parts class:

```python
from ldraw.parts import Parts
parts = Parts("parts.lst") # provide your custom parts.lst path
```

Parts can then be accessed using the relevant dictionary attributes of
the `parts` instance. For example:

```python
cowboy_hat = parts.minifig.hats["Hat Cowboy"]
head = parts.minifig.heads["Head with Solid Stud"]
brick1x1 = parts.others["Brick  1 x  1"]
```

## Writers and Tools

The `ldraw.writers` package aims to provide a set of classes that write
out LDraw descriptions in other file formats. Currently, it contains the
`povray` module which provides a class for writing out LDraw
descriptions as POV-Ray scenes.

The `ldr2pov` tool, uses the `povray` module to allow LDraw (`.ldr`)
files to be conveniently converted to POV-Ray (`.pov`) scene files. Note
that, since the LDraw format does not include information about camera
locations, it is necessary to pass this information on the command line.

For example, on a GNU/Linux system, we can execute command lines like
these to take the `figures.py` example file, create an LDraw model file
(`temp.ldr`), and convert that to a POV-Ray scene file (`temp.pov`):

```commandline
python examples/figures.py > temp.ldr
ldr2pov models/figures.ldr temp.pov 160.0,80.0,-240.0
povray +Itemp.pov +FN16 +Otemp.png +Q6
```
    

Finally, POV-Ray is used to process the scene description and create a
PNG image file (`temp.png`).

Some other tools and writers are included,

> -   ldr2inv:
>
> Transforms a LDR file into a file containing the Bill Of Materials or
> Inventory of the model
>
> -   ldr2png
>
> Renders the LDR file into a PNG file
>
> -   ldr2svg
>
> Renders the LDR file into a vector image in SVG
